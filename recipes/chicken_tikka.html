                <li>1 cup plain yogurt</li>

                <li>2 teaspoons ground coriander</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons garam masala</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
                <li>Fresh cilantro, chopped (for garnish)</li>
                <li>Lemon wedges (for serving)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol class= "instructions">
                <li>In a large bowl, combine the yogurt, lemon juice, ground cumin, ground coriander, garam masala, turmeric powder, paprika, ground ginger, minced garlic, salt, and black pepper. Stir well to make the marinade.</li>
                <li>Add the chicken pieces to the marinade, ensuring they are well-coated. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight for best results.</li>
                <li>Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. If using wooden skewers, soak them in water for 30 minutes to prevent burning.</li>
                <li>Thread the marinated chicken pieces onto the skewers. Brush them with vegetable oil to prevent sticking.</li>
                <li>Grill the chicken skewers for about 10-15 minutes, turning occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through and has a nice char. The internal temperature should reach 165°F (74°C).</li>
                <li>Remove the chicken from the grill and let it rest for a few minutes. Garnish with chopped fresh cilantro and serve with lemon wedges.</li>
